<h1>ðŸŒ² Binary Search Tree</h1>

For this project I decided to dive into the world of data structures and learn how to build a binary search tree. I've created it to be a command-line only program that contains the following 11 methods:

  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Find
  - Level Order
  - Preorder
  - Inorder
  - Postorder
  - Height
  - Depth
  - isBalanced
  - Rebalance
  
  A driver script is included for testing.
