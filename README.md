<h1>ðŸŒ² Binary Search Tree</h1>

For this project i've decided to dive into the world of data structures and learn how to build a binary search tree. This program has been designed to operate through a command-line interface, and it contains the following 11 methods:

  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Find
  - Level Order
  - Preorder
  - Inorder
  - Postorder
  - Height
  - Depth
  - isBalanced
  - Rebalance

  A driver script has been included to demonstrate how the program functions.
